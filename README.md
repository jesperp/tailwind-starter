# No-nonsense Tailwind CSS starter
Clone or degit the project. Then play with public/index.html and src/styles.css.

```bash
degit jesperp/tailwind-starter letsgo &&
cd letsgo &&
npm i &&
npm start
```

First time you start this project might take a few seconds for postcss to compile tailwind. After that, changes should be sub-second.
